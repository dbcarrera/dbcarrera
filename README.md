**`Entrepreneur/Developer/Learner`**

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a front-end developer with aspirations to one day be a unicorn ðŸ¦„. 

Not one of those rainbow dwelling creatures, but rather the founder of a private company worth over $1B ðŸ’¸.

I don't really have much to say, so here are some pictures of cars ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—:
